# TIPS

**✅ Bottom-Up (Tabulation):**
You start from the base cases and build your solution iteratively towards the final answer.

No recursion is involved.

Often modifies the input array or uses a DP table.

Efficient in terms of avoiding repeated work and stack overhead.

**✅ Top-Down (Memoization):**
You write a recursive solution and cache the results (memoize) to avoid redundant calculations.

Involves recursion and often uses a memoization array or hash map.
